# Abstract
By strategically employing particle effects, such as representations of smoke, explosions, fire, or rain, real-time applications can be visually enhanced. These effects enhance immersion and deliberately create moods within the scenes. Since particle effects are a crucial component of real-time applications, most game engines have systems for creating such effects. This paper compares the particle systems of the Unity and Unreal game engines. Within this analysis, the advantages and disadvantages of the systems are examined based on various quality criteria. The same particle effects are practically implemented in both engines, and differences in the systems in terms of reliability, usability, functionality, and performance are considered based on this implementation.
